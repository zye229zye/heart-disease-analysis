# Introduction

In this analysis, we utilize a dataset related to heart disease to explore the relationships between various risk factors（Age Chest Pain Cholesterol Levels） and the incidence of heart disease（target=1）.  Our objectives are to identify the key factors associated with heart disease risk and to provide deeper insights through statistical analysis and visualization.

# Data Loading
```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Load necessary libraries
library(readr)
data <- read_csv("data/heart.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```
```{r load-data,echo=FALSE}

knitr::kable(head(data), caption = "First few rows of the dataset")

```
#descriptive analysis

This section summarizes key characteristics of age, serum cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and heart disease presence using descriptive statistics.
```{r summary-table,echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("output/table1.png")
```
#Graphical Analysis

A scatter plot illustrates the relationship between serum cholesterol levels and age, differentiated by heart disease presence.
```{r, plot-data,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("output/scatter_plot.png")

```
#Regression Analysis

This section employs a generalized linear model to examine how age, serum cholesterol levels, and chest pain type affect the likelihood of heart disease.
# Fit the primary regression model
```{r, fit-primary-model,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("output/primary_model.png")

```

#Secondary Model

# Fit the secondary regression model
```{r, secondary-model,echo=FALSE}
# Include pre-generated secondary model table or text output
knitr::include_graphics("output/secondary_model.png")

```
